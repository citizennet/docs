The Basics
==========

Getting started with the CitizenNet API

Authentication
--------------


### Access Token

Send your access token with each request as part of the request header.

`Authorization: Token YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`

You may also alternatively send it via a query param.

`?access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`

###### **401 - Unauthorized** is returned if an invalid auth token is used.

Access tokens have a default expiration time of 30 minutes. This time will be bumped back to 30 minutes each
subsequent time a successful call is made with it.

### Authorization

Use HTTP [HTTP Basic Authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) to first obtain an access token.

Example Header:
`Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==`

**request a new access token**
##### `POST` _/users/authenticate_

###### **200 OK** - returns your user object with access token


**invalidate access token**
##### `POST` _/users/logout_

###### **200 OK** - "user logged out"


### SSL

Requests to the CitizenNet API should always be made via an https request.

`https://citizennet.com/api/v2/...`

API Responses
-------------

The API only makes use of only three HTTP status codes. An object with a more
descriptive key `message` will be returned with any error responses.  An
`error_code` is also returned for matching more specific error conditions.

* `200 - OK: Everything worked as expected`
* `400 - Client Error: Often missing a required parameter`
* `500 - Server Error: something is wrong on CitizenNetâ€™s end`

Successful calls return a JSON object:

    {
      "status": 200
      "message": "You Updated Things!"
    }
    
Errors return a JSON object:

    {
      "status": 400
      "error": "A description of the error",
    }

JSON data object keys will be camel cased and objects will be title cased.

    {
      "id": 55,
      "campaignName": "This is a Name",
      "Group": {
        "id": 10
        "groupName": "My Group Name"
      }
    }

Query String Parameters
-----------------------

These parameters can be applied to any API call to modify the resulting data set.


### Limit

`?limit=10`

Limit the number of results returned to `10`.

When omitted, the default is set to `25`.

### Skip

`?skip=50`

Return results starting at the 50th item in the data set.

Use this parameter to paginate through a lengthy list of results.

### Paging Data

`?paging=true`

Return pagination meta data for building pagination controls. API results are placed into a new key `data`
and pagination metadata is returned in a new key `paging`.

Example:

    {
      "data": ...,
      "paging": {
          "count": 181,
          "last": 61,
          "limit": 3,
          "skip": 1
        }
    }

### Dates

Limit results based on date.

`?dates=1352359716:1353396516`

Return results between two timestamps

`?dates=1352359716:`

Return results starting at timestamp 1352359716

`?dates=:1353396516`

Return results up until the timestamp 1353396516


### Fields

Return only the data fields you need for a given request. This is very helpful in limiting the
size of your requests.

`?fields=name:startDate:budget`

Return only the name, startDate, and budget fields.

Notifications
=============

Sends CitizenNet users a notification. Notifications exist in two forms:

- Sent as an email wrapped with the common CitizenNet email theme.
- Displayed in the users notifications center on the website.


Create A Notification
---------------------

##### `POST` _/notifications_ : generate a notification

Parameters
----------

### Required
- `notification_type` - You must specify a notification type for every notification to be sent. This allows for independent configuration of each type.
- One of the following ids:
    - `user_id` send to a single user
    - `company_id` send to everyone in a company
    - `campaign_id` send to everyone associated with a campaign
    - `group_id` send to everyone associated with a group Appropriate business members will also be bcc'd unless sending to a specific user_id.
- `data` - json object of notification display values
    - `heading`
    - `message`
    - `link`
    - `link_text`

Example

    {
      "notification_type": 1,
      "user_id": 123,
      "data": {
        "heading": "Report Generated",
        "message": "Your new report has been generated and ready to view",
        "link": "http://citizennet.com/myReport",
        "link_text": "View Report"
      }
    }

### Optional
- `to` - an array of email addresses These additional email addresses are merged into the TO field along with any other email addresses. If you want to copy yourself on notifications or send and email to a specific address use this field.
- `highlight_message` - If you pass in a campaign_id or group_id a simple formatted block of data with the group or campaign info will be displayed and the following variable will be available as a paragraph inside this block of data.

Notifications set to Admin Only will still send to addresses in the "to" field.

Example

    {
      "data": {
        "to": ["justin@citizennet.com"],
        "highlight_message": "Some addition al text inside a campaign or group block"
      }
    }

##### [How data is mapped to a notification](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s5/sh/ab0db813-c00a-4477-b4f7-28a7a4b9f65d/ee035ef23bb415cb30e559990aa95e54).


Notification Types
--------------------

Campaign types are defined in the MySql table `notification_type` and a record must be created in order to send a notification.
The `notification_type` that should be passed in every call is a primary key from this table.

A unique notification typically is a checksum of: `user_id + company_id + subject + notification_type_id + to + template_data`

By default unique notifications are only sent once. When the `repeat_email` field is `null` a notification will not be sent more than once, otherwise this value is the number of hours before allowing the same notification to be sent again. Notifications will be resent only if another API call is made for a unique notification. For instance, A cron that runs every 10 minutes and attempts to create a notification with an email_repeat of 6 hours will be sent on the first call. All calls after that will be ignored until 6 hours have passed, at which time the email will be resent.


Debugging
---------

Email addresses can be passed in the `debug` param and the notification will only be sent to those emails.

Example

    {
      "debug": ["justin@citizennet.com"]
    }
